If you are using a CLI (like the Window’s Command Prompt or Mac’s Terminal)
to run the tests scripts, it will throw an error as "Implement enable_gui in a subclass",
that has to do with some of the commands used in the notebooks (like %matplotlib inline).
So, if you want to run the test scripts, then please use Ipython shell (using the %run magic command). 
The code of the exercises is best to run it on Jupyter Notebooks.

In the notebooks of the exercises there is a cell at the begining of the code
that runs a data preparation script you have to execute in order to be able
to run the exercises.
